                    <p>Having just completed a total remodeling of our kitchen, we are compelled to pass along our gratitude to Pearson Remodeling Company and to provide an endorsement of their excellent work. The total project from removal of the old to the completion of the new kitchen was accomplished in two weeks with relatively little disruption to our routine. Their attention to detail, the precision and professionalism was outstanding. They are truly craftsmen in every respect. Their punctuality and reliability was greatly appreciated. It helped to ease the usual frustration and annoyance accompanying similar undertakings. We are grateful for their effort in providing an outcome that exceeded our expectations.</p>

                    <h1>Lorin and Abby Hanks, Herriman, Utah</h1>

                    <p>A few years ago my wife and I bought a new house with an unfinished basement. Recently the day came when we needed to finish the basement (to raise value in the home so we could refinance). My wife and I researched different companies. Subsequently, we had 3 different companies come give us a quote. Pearson Remodeling's price beat the closest competitor by a few thousand dollars. Yes, we picked Pearson Remodeling purely on price. Then we crossed our fingersâ€¦ I hear horror stories all the time about these construction guys not showing up or taking forever. I stressed for nothing. The Pearson brothers were here every single day they were scheduled. In fact if they were going to be late because they had to pick up supplies, we were notified accordingly. At the end of the work day they even said goodbye. The project lasted exactly as long as they as they had predicted. It went quickly. However that's not why I'm writing this review. The main reason I'd recommend Pearson Remodeling is because my wife and I were thrilled with the work that took place. I can't speak of one single thing that I didn't like. In fact I even insisted they do a few extra things (like make chord holes for my wall mount flat screen). They did it. Then they set up the TV then showed me how the wall mount system worked! Bottom line, I personally vouch for these guys. Honest, hard working, timely and efficient.</p>
